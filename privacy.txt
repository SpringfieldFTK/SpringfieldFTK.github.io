Springfield Ownership Transfer will use your account access to do the following:
	1. Connect to your Google Account
	2. Retrieve your email address
	3. Retrieve a list of all files in your Google Drive that you own and which are shared with "springfieldftk@gmail.com"
	4. Transfer ownership of all of those files to "springfieldftk@gmail.com"
This process happens solely on your computer through your browser.  No information related to your account or Google Drive is transfered to 
or stored on any computers or servers owned or operated by Springfield.  This information is not transferd to or stored by any third parties.
Once the process is complete, the application will not access your account unless you explicitly start the process again.
